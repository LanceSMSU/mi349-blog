        <h2>My Thoughts on Ark: Survival Ascended</h2>

        <p>Ark: Survival Ascended is a game that came out just a few days ago developed by the game studio Wildcard. This game was a long awaited remaster of the popular game Ark: Survival Evolved, a game that has the player survive on an island full of dinosaurs and experience the evolotion of technology as they progress through the game. After a surprise release of the game, fans rushed to download the game, myself included. This remaster promised many upgrades from the hit 2015 game including but not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Massively improved graphics</li>
            <li>Recreated ai algorithms for dinosaurs</li>
            <li>A building system overhaul</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sadly, Studio Wildcard is no stranger to sub-par launches. Ark Survival Evolved when it first dropped in 2015 was a truly mixed experience. On one hand the game was fanstastic and innovative, but on the other, the game was filled with game breaking bugs and performance issues. That being said, the developers patched the game over years and made a game that I can say is easily one of my favorites of all time. I'm sad to say that Ark: Survival Ascended is no different on release. When I first downloaded the game and loaded into a single player game, I was greeted with a massive amount of frame issues despite owning a high end pc. Online, it seemed that people that had average gaming setups were having even worse problems, with the game being almost unplayable even on low graphics settings. On top of this, I had numerous crashes while playing, which reset my progress that I had been working on, adding to the frustration. That being said, when the game worked, it worked well. It looks fantastic, and the game feels extremely well thought out with regards to attention to detail. As of writing this, Wildcard has already released three patches to attempt to tackle the performance and crashing issues. I truly hope that they can fix the current issues and built upon what is already out because I have extremely high hopes for this game.</p>

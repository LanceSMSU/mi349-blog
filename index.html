        <h2>My Thoughts on Ark: Survival Ascended</h2>

        <p>Ark: Survival Ascended is a game that came out just a few days ago developed by the game studio Wildcard. This game was a long awaited remaster of the popular game Ark: Survival Evolved, a game that has the player survive on an island full of dinosaurs and experience the evolotion of technology as they progress through the game. After a surprise release of the game, fans rushed to download the game, myself included. This remaster promised many upgrades from the hit 2015 game including but not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Massively improved graphics</li>
            <li>Recreated ai algorithms for dinosaurs</li>
            <li>A building system overhaul</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sadly, Studio Wildcard is no stranger to sub-par launches. Ark Survival Evolved when it first dropped in 2015 was a truly mixed experience. On one hand the game was fanstastic and innovative, but on the other, the game was filled with game breaking bugs and performance issues. That being said, the developers patched the game over years and made a game that I can say is easily one of my favorites of all time. I'm sad to say that Ark: Survival Ascended is no different on release. When I first downloaded the game and loaded into a single player game, I was greeted with a massive amount of frame issues despite owning a high end pc. Online, it seemed that people that had average gaming setups were having even worse problems, with the game being almost unplayable even on low graphics settings. On top of this, I had numerous crashes while playing, which reset my progress that I had been working on, adding to the frustration. That being said, when the game worked, it worked well. It looks fantastic, and the game feels extremely well thought out with regards to attention to detail. As of writing this, Wildcard has already released three patches to attempt to tackle the performance and crashing issues, which has helped a little, but has not fully mended the problems that I have experienced. I truly hope that they can fix the current issues and built upon what is already out because I have extremely high hopes for this game.</p>

        <h2>Best Pizza Places I Have Visited in the East Lansing Area</h2>
        <address class="author">By <a rel="author" href="about.html">Lance Stemple</a></address> 
            on <time pubdate datetime="2023-10-28" title="October 28th, 2023">10/28/23</time>
        <p>One of my favorite foods is pizza. Upon moving to East Lansing, I wanted to go to a lot of different places to see how pizza was in the area. I decided to leave out popular chains like Little Ceasars and Hungry Howies out of the table because I wanted to compare less well known places. The first place I went to was Buddy's Pizza. The first thing I noticed was that the prices of the food was unusually high, which sort of turned me off to the idea of coming back. However, when I got my food, I was surprised to find it was my favorite tasting pizza that I've had. I ordered a detroit style 4 corner pizza and it was fanstastic. I would definitely recommend Buddy's if you are able to spend the extra money and want pizza that is fanstastic in taste. The second place was one that was very close to my apartment, Marco's Pizza. Unlike the previous place, Marco's was quite affordable. For the price, the taste is definitely very good which is great. Overall, I think this is the most well rounded place that I have visited so far. Finally, I went to Mancino's. This one was also pretty well rounded, being slightly more expensive than Marco's while maintaining about the same taste score.</p>

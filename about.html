    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Professional and Acedemic</h2>
        <p>My name is Lance Stemple. I'm a computer science student in my third year at Michigan State University.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I always had a fascination with technology. I started playing video games and discovering the internet at a young age and became entranced by not only the fun of the technology itself, but how it was created. This was when I discovered what I wanted to do.</p>

        <p> Since then, I decided to test if coding was really what I wanted to do by taking the computer science courses in high school. I absolutely loved them. During my high school career I wanted to know what it was like to work at a company that developed applications and that's when I landed a job at Motorcity Systems as a quality assurance intern in my Junior year. Since then, I graduated and decided to enroll in Michigan State University as a Computer Science major.    
        Over the years between graduating high school and now, I've learned a lot. I learned the importance of source control when working with a team and found out how developing in a scrum setting worked. Once I learned how web based applications worked and the methodology and criteria to test them both manually or by writing automated tests, I began to develop the products themselves by becoming a software development intern.</p>
            
        <p>In combination with my schooling, I learned how to code in many different languages such as C++, Python, and Typescript. I also learned how important HTML and CSS can be especially when creating web based applications. I learned what object oriented programing was and how I can use it to create incredible things, and what exactly software design meant. I also learned how to communicate efficiently and effectively as well as presenting my work to a team, both of which are critical in working with others.</p>
            
        <p>Today, I look to further improve my learning in the field of computer science as well as contributing my already gained knowledge to a company that makes a difference. The world of technology is vast and always changing, and I want to work with a team to stay on top of that change and create something truly great.</p>
